The analisys over these boxplots follow a top-down structure. So, first things that we may say are related with the mean in fact each set of ten boxplots have, more or less, the same mean value, i.e. around zero, but with a very small flactuation in the 100-samples cases. Same story is on the maximum and minimum values but with different values in case the samples come from a normal distribution or t distribution, but in this case we have to look according which distribution the samples belong to (more ditails will be given later). Last comment on the overall boxplots is about the box-size defined by the quantilies: as we can see the box-size for the normal distributions is larger than the box-size for the t distribution, also if we consider the set of boxplots with less samples.

Now, we may say something more by looking each of the four set of boxes. 
In the top-left quarter, max and min values are, more or less, close to 2.3 in absolute value, and it is the same for the quantiles with value 0.2; this is quite important because it means this normal distribution is very simmetric. Moreover, according the heavy-tail definition, we know that 1% of the samples are possible outliers, and this is shown by the set of points outside the "whiskers"; in particular, more far from the first and third quantiles they are and more suitable they are to be outliers. In this case, more than half boxes have some candidates outliers.

In the bottom-left quarter, max and min values are not more fixed as the previous situation: now, each boxplot has its how values for them, but in any case they differ for some units. Moreover, the first and third quantiles are no more fixed in each boxes, and the "whiskers" on both sides have different distances, so this event is interesting because it shows the asymmetry of the distribution with no so much samples. In this set of boxplots, we may expect to have one point as possible outliers for each box, and some of them follow this path but just less than half set has outliers. Quite opposite event in respect the previous one.

In the top-right quarter we have a t distribution and this case is very similar to the first one but having different values for min, max and quantiles. Moreover, these parameters stay fixed and the "whiskers" have the same length, so the symmetry is respected. In the end, for what concern possible outliers we have to be careful, because most of the outsider points are very close to each other and very close to the "whiskers" borders, so it is not so immediate say something; more deep analysis is suggested in this case.

In the bottom-right quarter, things are now similar to the bottom-left quarter, so the simmetry is not more present and the boxes have different sizes. However, in this last case, there are more possible outliers along the different boxes, and they are more easy to be localized (in contrast with the previous case in which it is not true).
